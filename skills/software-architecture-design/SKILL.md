description: Transforms system architecture and system requirements into a concrete software architecture — firmware module decomposition, RTOS thread/ISR model, memory budget allocation, and inter-module data flows. Use when system architecture is confirmed and detailed firmware design can begin, when evaluating software architecture alternatives, or when downstream software-detailed-design detects missing architecture decisions.

# Software Architecture Design

## Overview

System architecture says which modules exist and how they interface. Software architecture says how those modules run — which thread owns which module, how much stack each thread gets, which ISRs are latency-critical, and how data flows between modules without deadlocks or race conditions.

This skill transforms the software-domain slice of system requirements and system architecture into a concrete software architecture document — the contract between the SE and the firmware team. Every thread assignment traces to a timing requirement. Every memory allocation is justified. Every lock is documented. If the RTOS or framework imposes a constraint, this skill verifies it rather than assuming.

## When to Use

- System architecture is confirmed and software-domain requirements are extracted
- Starting firmware architecture design (thread model, memory map, IPC design)
- Evaluating RTOS selection or framework architecture alternatives
- A design review or downstream skill detects a software architecture gap
- The firmware team needs a formal software architecture document before module implementation

**When NOT to use:**

- System architecture is not yet designed (run `architecture-design` first)
- The change is a single function implementation with no module or interface impact
- Pure hardware architecture (use `hardware-architecture-design`)
- Writing actual firmware code (this skill produces architecture, not implementation)

## Context Boundary

**Read ONLY:**
- System architecture document (module decomposition, interface definitions)
- SW-domain system requirements (timing, throughput, reliability, memory constraints)
- RTOS / framework documentation (API reference, configuration limits, ISR architecture)
- Target MCU/SoC technical reference manual (memory map, interrupt controller, MPU/MMU)

**Do NOT read:** hardware specifications (pin assignments, voltage domains, PCB constraints), chip datasheets beyond the memory map section, test plans, or build system files.

If a software architecture decision requires hardware input (e.g., "does this MCU have a DMA engine for the SPI?"), check only the specific TRM chapter — do not read the full hardware design. If the answer is not in the TRM, surface an Open Item with the HW team as owner.

## The Process

```
INPUT-GATE → THREAD-MODEL → IPC-DESIGN → MEMORY-BUDGET → DATA-FLOW → DOCUMENT
     │            │             │             │             │           │
     ▼            ▼             ▼             ▼             ▼           ▼
  Verify      Assign        Design        Allocate      Map data     Produce
  inputs &    modules to    inter-module  RAM/ROM/      flows        software
  versions    threads/ISRs  communication stack budget  between      architecture
                                                  modules      document
```

### Step 1: INPUT-GATE — Verify inputs and RTOS constraints

Confirm input artifacts are available and version-aligned before proceeding. This is a hard gate — do not design against stale or unconfirmed inputs.

```
INPUT VERIFICATION:
1. System Architecture: [path, version, date]
2. SW-Domain System Requirements: [path, version, date]
3. RTOS / Framework: [name, version, documentation path]
4. Target MCU/SoC: [part number, datasheet rev]
→ Confirm: Are these the correct versions? Any missing?
```

**RTOS capability verification (CRITICAL — do NOT skip):** Do NOT assume RTOS capabilities from memory. Verify against the RTOS documentation:
- Maximum number of threads supported
- Maximum number of priority levels
- ISR latency (worst-case entry + exit in CPU cycles and μs)
- Context switch time (same-priority yield and preemption)
- Queue/message size limits, event group width, semaphore max count
- Memory protection support (MPU/MMU regions available)
- Tick resolution (default and configurable range)

If the RTOS documentation is unavailable, surface an Open Item and stop. If a required RTOS capability is absent (e.g., you need 16 priority levels but the RTOS only supports 8), that is a CONSTRAINT VIOLATION — surface immediately.

### Step 2: THREAD-MODEL — Assign every module to a thread or ISR

Every module from the System Architecture module table must be assigned to exactly one execution context. "It runs somewhere" is not an assignment.

**Thread Assignment Table:**

```markdown
| Thread / ISR | Priority | Modules Assigned | Stack Size | Blocking? | Wake-up Trigger | Deadline |
|-------------|----------|-----------------|------------|-----------|-----------------|----------|
| ISR_GPT0 (50μs tick) | IRQ 10 | System Tick, Scheduler | — (ISR stack) | Never | 50μs HW timer | ≤ 10μs execution |
| THD_SensorHub | 3 (high) | SEN-01 IMU Fusion, SEN-02 Temp Monitor | 4 KB | Yes (k_msgq) | Sensor data-ready ISR | ≤ 1ms processing |
| THD_CommsMgr | 4 | COM-01 eSPI Slave, COM-02 I2C Host | 6 KB | Yes (k_sem, k_msgq) | eSPI transaction ISR | ≤ 100μs response |
| THD_PwrMgr | 5 | PWR-01 Rail Monitor, PWR-02 Seq Engine | 2 KB | Yes (k_event) | GPIO interrupts | ≤ 500μs state change |
| THD_Logger | 6 (low) | LOG-01 Flash Journal | 3 KB | Yes (k_msgq) | Message queued from any thread | None (best-effort) |
```

**Rules:**
- Two modules assigned to the same thread: document the execution order. Module A → Module B, or round-robin, or priority-queue.
- ISRs must NOT call blocking RTOS functions (`k_msgq_get` with timeout, `k_sem_take` with timeout). ISRs may call `k_msgq_put`, `k_sem_give`, `k_event_post` (non-blocking signaling only).
- Every thread priority must be justified against a timing requirement. "Priority 3 because it's important" is not justification. Priority 3 because "SYS-REQ-014 requires ≤ 1ms sensor processing" is.

### Step 3: IPC-DESIGN — Design inter-module communication

For every dependency arrow (→) in the System Architecture module table, define the software communication mechanism. Every named interface (IF-XXX) from System Architecture must have a corresponding IPC mechanism defined here. "They communicate somehow" is not a design.

**IPC Mechanism Table:**

```markdown
| IF-ID | From (Thread) | To (Thread) | Mechanism | Object Name | Data Direction | Blocking Policy | Message Size |
|-------|--------------|-------------|-----------|-------------|---------------|-----------------|-------------|
| IF-001 | ISR_GPT0 | THD_SensorHub | k_event | evt_sensor_tick | Publish | Non-blocking (ISR post) | 4 bits (event flags) |
| IF-002 | THD_CommsMgr | THD_PwrMgr | k_msgq | mq_cmd_power | Command | TX: k_msgq_put (100ms timeout); RX: k_msgq_get (K_FOREVER) | 64 bytes |
| IF-003 | THD_SensorHub | THD_Logger | k_msgq | mq_log_data | Data | TX: k_msgq_put (non-blocking, drop oldest if full); RX: k_msgq_get (K_FOREVER) | 128 bytes |
| IF-004 | THD_PwrMgr | THD_CommsMgr | k_msgq | mq_pwr_status | Status | TX: k_msgq_put (100ms); RX: k_msgq_get (K_FOREVER) | 32 bytes |
| IF-005 | THD_SensorHub (internal) | THD_SensorHub (internal) | mutex | mtx_sensor_data | Shared memory guard | k_mutex_lock (1ms timeout) | — (protects sensor_data_t) |
```

**Synchronization documentation — for every shared resource:**

```markdown
### Lock: mtx_sensor_data
| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Protects | sensor_data_t g_sensor (global struct) |
| Owner(s) | THD_SensorHub (write), THD_CommsMgr (read) |
| Lock order | mtx_sensor_data before mq_log_data (if both held) |
| Max hold time | ≤ 50μs (critical section: copy struct to local) |
| Deadlock prevention | Single global lock ordering: mtx_sensor_data → mtx_flash_journal → mtx_power_state. All threads follow this order. |
```

### Step 4: MEMORY-BUDGET — Allocate SRAM, Flash, and stack

Allocate physical memory and verify the budget closes. Numbers, not adjectives.

```markdown
## SRAM Budget (total: 256 KB)

| Allocation | Size | Justification |
|-----------|------|---------------|
| .bss / .data (globals) | 12 KB | All global structs (see appendix) |
| THD_SensorHub stack | 4 KB | Worst-case call chain: IMU driver → fusion → queue TX (1.8 KB) + ISR frame (0.5 KB) + margin (1.7 KB) |
| THD_CommsMgr stack | 6 KB | eSPI driver deep stack (4.2 KB measured) + margin |
| THD_PwrMgr stack | 2 KB | Shallow call chain (0.8 KB) + margin |
| THD_Logger stack | 3 KB | Flash driver stack (1.5 KB) + margin |
| System heap | 32 KB | k_msgq buffers (18 KB: 6 queues × avg 3 KB) + driver DMA buffers (14 KB) |
| DMA buffers (USB, eSPI) | 64 KB | USB EP0 (4 KB) + USB EP1 (32 KB) + eSPI channel (28 KB) |
| MPU guard regions | 4 KB | 8 × 32-byte guard regions per MPU spec |
| Reserved (future) | 16 KB | Headroom for additional features per SYS-REQ-030 |
| **Remaining free** | 113 KB | — |
```

If `total_allocated > total_physical`, that is a CONSTRAINT VIOLATION — surface immediately with options (reduce buffers, renegotiate requirements, or add external SRAM).

### Step 5: DATA-FLOW — Map timing-critical data paths

For every timing-critical data path identified in system requirements, trace the complete flow through all modules, threads, ISRs, and IPC objects. Calculate end-to-end latency and compare to the timing constraint.

```markdown
### Critical Path: Sensor Sample → Host Notification

| Step | Context | Action | Latency (μs) | Cumulative (μs) |
|------|---------|--------|-------------|-----------------|
| 1 | IMU (HW) | Sample ready, fires GPIO IRQ | — | 0 |
| 2 | ISR_GPT0 | ISR entry, post k_event to THD_SensorHub | 2 (ISR latency) | 2 |
| 3 | THD_SensorHub | Wakes on event, reads IMU FIFO via SPI | 15 (SPI DMA) | 17 |
| 4 | THD_SensorHub | Sensor fusion computation | 80 (measured @ 200 MHz) | 97 |
| 5 | THD_SensorHub | k_msgq_put to THD_Logger + THD_CommsMgr | 5 (context switch) | 102 |
| 6 | THD_CommsMgr | Wakes, formats eSPI packet, posts to HW FIFO | 30 | 132 |
| 7 | eSPI (HW) | Packet transmitted to host | 8 (eSPI @ 66 MHz) | 140 |

**Result:** End-to-end 140 μs ≤ SYS-REQ-014 (≤ 200 μs) → PASS
```

For every timing-critical path that exceeds its constraint, surface as a TIMING VIOLATION with options: optimize the slowest step, raise the deadline, or accept the violation with documented rationale.

### Step 6: DOCUMENT — Produce the software architecture document

Assemble all outputs into a structured document. Present to user for confirmation. Do NOT proceed to `software-detailed-design` until the human has explicitly confirmed that every thread assignment, IPC mechanism, memory allocation, and data flow is correct.

## Interaction with Other Skills

- **`architecture-design`**: Pre-requisite. Produces system-level module decomposition and interface definitions.

## Common Rationalizations

| Rationalization | Reality |
|---|---|
| "The firmware team can figure out the thread model during implementation" | Thread models designed during implementation optimize for the first module written. Thread models designed in architecture optimize for all modules. The difference is deadlocks discovered during integration. |
| "Memory budget is premature — we will optimize later" | Memory is finite. "We will optimize later" means "we will discover we are out of memory during integration." An SRAM overrun is not a compiler warning — it is silent corruption. |
| "IPC is just function calls — do not over-engineer it" | Function calls work when caller and callee share a thread. When they do not — and in an RTOS they often do not — you need queues, events, and locks. "Keep it simple" that ignores concurrency is simplicity that causes heisenbugs. |
| "Stack sizes are the RTOS default — it is fine" | RTOS defaults are for hello-world. A thread that calls into a driver stack, a filesystem, and a logging framework needs 4-8x the default. Under-sized stacks cause silent corruption — the stack overflows into the next thread's memory and neither thread knows. |
| "We will measure stack usage on the prototype" | Measurement on one code path tells you the depth of that path. It does not tell you the depth of the error-recovery path, the worst-case interrupt nesting path, or the path that only triggers at -40°C. Design stacks for worst case; measure to confirm. |
| "The RTOS handles all synchronization — we just use its APIs" | The RTOS provides mutexes, semaphores, and queues. It does not prevent you from using them incorrectly. Lock ordering, priority inversion, and deadlock are design problems, not API problems. |

## Red Flags

- Modules without execution context assignment (a module not assigned to a thread will not run)
- IPC mechanisms not specified for interface dependencies (an IF-ID without a mechanism is a contract without a delivery method)
- Memory budget that exceeds physical SRAM or flash — surface, do not assume "we will find savings later"
- Stack size specified as "RTOS default" without verification against actual call depth
- Data flow latency not calculated for timing-critical paths ("probably fast enough" is not a calculation)
- Thread priorities not justified against timing requirements (priority is a budget, not a preference)
- ISRs calling blocking functions (this works in testing until it doesn't — and it fails silently)
- Lock ordering not documented when more than one lock exists in the system
- "We will use the reference design thread model" — reference designs optimize for demonstration, not your requirements
- No stack overflow detection mechanism specified (MPU guard, canary, or static analysis)

## Verification

Before handing off to software-detailed-design, confirm:

- [ ] All input artifacts version-verified (Step 1 input gate passed; RTOS capabilities confirmed against documentation)
- [ ] Every module assigned to exactly one execution context with priority, stack size, and wake-up trigger
- [ ] Every thread priority justified against a timing requirement ID (REQ-XXX)
- [ ] Every architecture interface (IF-XXX) has a corresponding IPC mechanism with object name, direction, blocking policy, and message size
- [ ] ISR latency budgets verified against RTOS and CPU specifications; ISRs never call blocking functions
- [ ] Memory budget accounts for all allocations (SRAM + Flash); total ≤ physical limit with remaining headroom documented
- [ ] Stack sizes trace to worst-case call chain analysis — not RTOS defaults, not guesses
- [ ] Every timing-critical data flow has end-to-end latency calculated step-by-step and compared to its constraint
- [ ] Every timing violation surfaced with specific options (optimize, relax constraint, or accept with rationale)
- [ ] Lock ordering documented for every lock; deadlock prevention strategy specified
- [ ] Stack overflow detection mechanism specified (MPU guard region or runtime canary)
- [ ] Open items have owners and due dates; no naked TBDs
- [ ] The human has explicitly confirmed the software architecture document
- [ ] The document is saved to a version-controlled location under `docs/architecture/`

## After This Skill

Once software architecture is confirmed and saved to `docs/architecture/`:

| Next Step | Skill | What It Produces |
|-----------|-------|-----------------|
| **Natural next** | `software-detailed-design` | Function signatures, data structures, state machines per firmware module |
| System integration | `spec-authoring` | Generate Software Outline Design (SOD) for the firmware team |
| Quality check | `traceability-matrix` | Verify requirements → SW architecture traceability |
